IS from Information Systems. WordPress plugin that connects website forms and CRM
As an ERP Consultant, I took on a project in my 2nd year of work. The subject matter was the integration of a WordPress site with CRM. Specifically, when a visitor or user of the site (configuration option) submits a contact form to the site, at the same time a ticket (CRM Entity) is created in the ERP database. At the same time, the visitor/user is updated by email. For the implementation, in addition to the ERP Configuration and Scripts, on the site, a Plugin had to be created which sends the information to the ERP. The plugin requires a minimum version of WP 5.9.3 and PHP 7.4. I am attaching a sample plugin classes. Next upgrade will include e-shop integration with ERP.
